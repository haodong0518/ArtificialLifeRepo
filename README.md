# ArtificialLife Project
Step 3: Fitness Function and Iterative Simulations.

# Objective: 
This step procedurally generate random bodies and evaluate the bodies in simulation according to a fitness measure of your choosing.

# Tasks:
1. Modify the fitness function to favor the distance traveled.
2. Using the best feature with highest fittness score as a baseline to do subsequent evolutions.
